      <h2>Moving to ambersplace.net</h2>

      <p><i>July 7th, 2025</i></p>

      <p>I bought a domain! Finally! And a VPS to host this site on! I've wanted to self-host this site for ages, but
      with my current housing situation that really isn't feasible. So, I got a VPS through racknerd.</p>

      <p>My friend <a href="https://nova.gay/" target="_blank" aria-label="opens external site in a new window">
        nova</a> reccomended them to me, cause she hosts her site and matrix server with them. I got a VPS with
        2 gigs of ram, 2 cpu cores, and 30gb of storage for like $17 a <i>year</i>, which is wild.</p>

      <p>I've set both ambersplace.github.io and ambersplace.neocities.org to redirect to ambersplace.net. That way
        all my friend's links to my site will still work.</p>

      <p>The web server I'm using is <a href="https://www.lighttpd.net/" target="_blank"
        aria-label="opens external site in a new window">lighttpd</a>. It's a server I've used in the past and it is
        simple to use. I don't like to build systems that I don't understand lol.

      <p>I removed the references to neocities and github from the homepage, and once again adjusted it. I'm still not
        happy with it, but it's better. I also changed the disclaimer text at the bottom to clarify the way my new
        setup logs information. The way it's set up is default lighttpd behavior. I've also fixed the
        <a href="computers.html">computers</a> page, which was missing text for my new laptop.</p>

      <p><b>UPDATE:</b> I have started logging request info, and changed the text accordingly.
        This is so I can detect AI/scraper/bot uses and mitigate them.</p>

      <p>On the personal side, it's going better. Been moving around a lot, and that's not going to stop, but I'm
        doin ok. I'd like to have my server/nas set up again soon, but we'll see.</p>

      <p>Anyways, that's all I have for now. Big changes! Good stuff! See y'all :3</p>

      <h2>Hello hello!</h2>

      <p><i>January 10th, 2025</i></p>

      <p>I've added a blog! Been meaning to do that for a while, and I finally had something good to write about.
        It may seem simple, but that took me multiple days to figure out. Modern internet moment ig.</p>

      <p>I also did some slight changes to the home page, nothing major.</p>

      <p>Now, personal time. I've been getting my life back together, getting things sorted out. It's going pretty
        okay. We'll see how it goes from here.</p>

      <p>I appreciate ya'll being here.<p>

      <h2>Hey.</h2>

      <p><i>December 17th, 2024</i></p>

      <p>I'm still figuring out how to live after everything that happened. I'll probably never live in that house
        again. We've got a new place now, and we're settling in, but it's just been pretty stressful lately.</p>

      <p>Anyways, I've begun to start a small, portable collection of things again. This is probably it, tbh, but
        I'll keep y'all updated. I've updated the computers and minidisc pages with the new finds.</p>

      <p>I also plan to add some sort of photography page. I've lost most of my gear, but I have things to say
        about what I still have. So get ready for that.</p>

      <p>I've finally replaced the index header image. Been meaning to do that for a while. Finally found a pic of
        Hibari-kun I like, thats big enough. Who would have thought that an 80s, somewhat obscure anime/manga would
        only have low resolution images online.</p>

      <p>I'm here, I'm safe, and I appreciate y'all. See you soon.</p>

      <h2>Hello.</h2>

      <p><i>October 4th, 2024</i></p>

      <p>You may have noticed that some new text has been added to the hoard pages. My house was completely destroyed
        in hurricane Helene. I am still reeling from this, honestly. Consider the hoard page an archive. I don't think
        I will be collecting anything again in a long time. I don't trust this area not to destroy everything again.
        I'll update the pages with everything I end up with, and I'll add what I had but never uploaded. </p>

      <p>Don't worry, me and my family and my cats are all okay.</p>

      <p>Also, cohost is officially dead. I used a tool called <a target=”_blank”
        href="https://github.com/cpsdqs/cohost-dl" aria-label="opens external site in a new window">cohost-dl</a> to
        download an arhive of my cohost page. It's pretty large so we'll see if github pages will allow me to upload
        it here. If not, I'll update this paragraph accordingly.</p>
      <p>It really sucks that cohost is gone. I'll miss it. I loved it.<p>

      <p>Sorry for the sad article, but it reflects how I'm feeling these days. I love y'all. Stay safe.</p>

      <p>"Holy shit, an update that didn't take 3 months" - ambersplace viewer </p>
      
      <p>I updated the computers page. I'll be adding images soon. At some point I'll be updating the minidisc page,
      my collection has grown substantially.</p>

      <p>Hope you're doing well.</p>

      <h2>Hello again</h2>

      <p><i>September 10th, 2024</i></p>

      <p>Some small updates today. Added a new friend, radmin. Also updated my socials, as I gave up tumblr and cohost
      is dying. I'm very sad to see it go. I've added my mastadon for the meantime, I've never really had it stick for
      me but hey, we'll see.</p>

      <p>Happy 9/11 tomorrow.</p>

      <h2>A bit of work for once</h2>
    
      <p><i>March 4th, 2024</i></p>

      <p>I really can't keep up with this thing huh. I hope to do more but I've moved things around. Watch your step.
        I've also linked my cohost, as I've become more active on it ever since tumblr's ceo decided to have a temper 
        tantrum over a tgirl transition timeline. Haven't deleted my tumblr yet but I've been thinking about it a lot.
      </p>
      
      <p>I rewrote the intro to the site on the main page cause I haven't really liked it for a while. This one more 
        accurately portrays my current feelings lol. I've also finally removed the vestigial <i>media.html</i> as it's 
        purpose is long gone.
      </p>

      <p>I'm strongly considering just getting rid of the neocities mirror cause neocities doesn't really work for me.
        They do good work and I'm glad for what they do for people, especially newcomers to the web space, but their
        tools just don't work for me very well. I can't upload some things that I'd like and updating my site on there
        is a pain. I'll keep doing it for now though. We shall see.
      </p>

      <p>Thanks for reading and I hope you see some good today.</p>

      <h2>Site restructuring</h2>
    
      <p><i>January 9th, 2023</i></p>
    
      <p>Hello! It has once again been a hot minute!</p>

      <p>I've decided to come back and work on the site once more. I'm working on some restructuring that I've been
        meaning to do for a while. The plan is to add a lot more info about the various electronics I own, and seperate 
        this into it's own section. The MiniDisc section will be moved here. Been considering calling it "the hoard."
      </p>

      <p>I've modified the hompage some to simplify it as I found it quite busy, and moved my socials from their 
        own page to the homepage.
      </p>

      <p>I've also found a tool called <a target=”_blank” href="https://github.com/tatsumoto-ren/bashcities" 
        aria-label="opens external site in a new window">bashcities</a> (thanks lisa!) that allows me to manage the 
        neocities mirror from a git repo. This will allow me to merge the codebase for the github mirror and neocities 
        mirror. Hopefully this will make things easier for me.</p>

      <p>You may also notice that the link to the media section is gone from the homepage. The page is still there
        but no longer serves much purpose as neither github nor neocities allows hosting media on their sites. This may 
        change in the future, but for now, it wont be easily accessible.
      </p>

      <p>I am looking in to self hosting, but that may not work out. Potentially a reverse proxy could allow me to
        hide my ip, but we will see.
      </p>

      <p>I also changed the color outside the content for a nicer look.</p>

      <p>Thanks for reading!~</p>

      <h2>Fixes and new MiniDisc Content</h2>

      <p><i>April 18th, 2022</i></p>

      <p>Hello! It's been a minute but I'm finally doing a bit more work on the site. Life's been crazy lately.</p>

      <p>I've made a fix to the <a href="media.html">media</a> page that allows it to scroll properly. I'm not sure how 
        that evaded me for so long. I've also shortened the line length of all html files to 130 characters. It doesn't 
        make a usability difference, but it makes me happy. I've italicized the date of news posts as well.</p>

      <p>I've also added some new content to the <a href="minidisc.html">minidisc</a> page, mainly photos but some new 
      text as well. The images aren't clickable to open a larger version in a new tab yet, I accidentally deleted 
      the fullres versions and need to re copy them from my phone. That's what I get for working on the production 
      version.</p>

      <h2>Initial update</h2>
      
      <p><i>Jan 25th, 2022</i></p>
      
      <p>Hello! I've decided to make a news section as there's a lot of weirdness with hosting right now.</p>
      
      <p>I've done some hosting on neocities.org and now github, but neither allow me to host media. Neocities has 
        filetype restrictions and github has filesize restrictions.</p>
      
      <p>It's quite annoying. I do have a self-hosted copy of the site, but I don't have a domain for it, and my public 
        ip isn't stable, so I can't give it out. 
      
      <p>Some recent changes include the github mirror (<a href="https://ambersplace.github.io/" target="_blank" 
        aria-label="opens external site in a new window">ambersplace.github.io</a>) and some font optimizations. The 
        site should load faster and cleaner now.
      
      <p>That's all from me today. Thanks for browsing.</p>
