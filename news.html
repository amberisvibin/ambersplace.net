    <p>Hello! I've decided to make a news section as there's a lot of weirdness with hosting right now.</p>
    
    <p>I've done some hosting on neocities.org and now github, but neither allow me to host media. Neocities has filetype restrictions and github has filesize restrictions.</p>
    
    <p>It's quite annoying. I do have a self-hosted copy of the site, but I don't have a domain for it, and my public ip isn't stable, so I can't give it out. 
    
    <p>Some recent changes include the github mirror (<a href="https://ambersplace.github.io/" target="_blank" aria-label="opens external site in a new window">ambersplace.github.io</a>) and some font optimizations. The site should load faster and cleaner now.
    
    <p>That's all from me today. Thanks for browsing.</p>
