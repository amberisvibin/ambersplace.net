      <h2>Fixes and new MiniDisc Content</h2>

      <p><i>April 18th, 2022</i></p>

      <p>Hello! It's been a minute but I'm finally doing a bit more work on the site. Life's been crazy lately.</p>

      <p>I've made a fix to the <a href="media.html">media</a> page that allows it to scroll properly. I'm not sure how 
        that evaded me for so long. I've also shortened the line length of all html files to 130 characters. It doesn't 
        make a usability difference, but it makes me happy. I've italicized the date of news posts as well.</p>

      <p>I've also added some new content to the <a href="minidisc.html">minidisc</a> page, mainly photos but some new 
      text as well. The images aren't clickable to open a larger version in a new tab yet, I accidentally deleted 
      the fullres versions and need to re copy them from my phone. That's what I get for working on the production 
      version.</p>

      <h2>Initial update</h2>
      
      <p><i>Jan 25th, 2022</i></p>
      
      <p>Hello! I've decided to make a news section as there's a lot of weirdness with hosting right now.</p>
      
      <p>I've done some hosting on neocities.org and now github, but neither allow me to host media. Neocities has 
        filetype restrictions and github has filesize restrictions.</p>
      
      <p>It's quite annoying. I do have a self-hosted copy of the site, but I don't have a domain for it, and my public 
        ip isn't stable, so I can't give it out. 
      
      <p>Some recent changes include the github mirror (<a href="https://ambersplace.github.io/" target="_blank" 
        aria-label="opens external site in a new window">ambersplace.github.io</a>) and some font optimizations. The 
        site should load faster and cleaner now.
      
      <p>That's all from me today. Thanks for browsing.</p>
