      <h2>A bit of work for once</h2>
    
      <p><i>March 4th, 2024</i></p>

      <p>I really can't keep up with this thing huh. I hope to do more but I've moved things around. Watch your step.
        I've also linked my cohost, as I've become more active on it ever since tumblr's ceo decided to have a temper 
        tantrum over a tgirl transition timeline. Haven't deleted my tumblr yet but I've been thinking about it a lot.
      </p>
      
      <p>I rewrote the intro to the site on the main page cause I haven't really liked it for a while. This one more 
        accurately portrays my current feelings lol. I've also finally removed the vestigial <i>media.html</i> as it's 
        purpose is long gone.
      </p>

      <p>I'm strongly considering just getting rid of the neocities mirror cause neocities doesn't really work for me.
        They do good work and I'm glad for what they do for people, especially newcomers to the web space, but their
        tools just don't work for me very well. I can't upload some things that I'd like and updating my site on there
        is a pain. I'll keep doing it for now though. We shall see.
      </p>

      <p>Thanks for reading and I hope you see some good today.</p>

      <h2>Site restructuring</h2>
    
      <p><i>January 9th, 2023</i></p>
    
      <p>Hello! It has once again been a hot minute!</p>

      <p>I've decided to come back and work on the site once more. I'm working on some restructuring that I've been
        meaning to do for a while. The plan is to add a lot more info about the various electronics I own, and seperate 
        this into it's own section. The MiniDisc section will be moved here. Been considering calling it "the hoard."
      </p>

      <p>I've modified the hompage some to simplify it as I found it quite busy, and moved my socials from their 
        own page to the homepage.
      </p>

      <p>I've also found a tool called <a target=”_blank” href="https://github.com/tatsumoto-ren/bashcities" 
        aria-label="opens external site in a new window">bashcities</a> (thanks lisa!) that allows me to manage the 
        neocities mirror from a git repo. This will allow me to merge the codebase for the github mirror and neocities 
        mirror. Hopefully this will make things easier for me.</p>

      <p>You may also notice that the link to the media section is gone from the homepage. The page is still there
        but no longer serves much purpose as neither github nor neocities allows hosting media on their sites. This may 
        change in the future, but for now, it wont be easily accessible.
      </p>

      <p>I am looking in to self hosting, but that may not work out. Potentially a reverse proxy could allow me to
        hide my ip, but we will see.
      </p>

      <p>I also changed the color outside the content for a nicer look.</p>

      <p>Thanks for reading!~</p>

      <h2>Fixes and new MiniDisc Content</h2>

      <p><i>April 18th, 2022</i></p>

      <p>Hello! It's been a minute but I'm finally doing a bit more work on the site. Life's been crazy lately.</p>

      <p>I've made a fix to the <a href="media.html">media</a> page that allows it to scroll properly. I'm not sure how 
        that evaded me for so long. I've also shortened the line length of all html files to 130 characters. It doesn't 
        make a usability difference, but it makes me happy. I've italicized the date of news posts as well.</p>

      <p>I've also added some new content to the <a href="minidisc.html">minidisc</a> page, mainly photos but some new 
      text as well. The images aren't clickable to open a larger version in a new tab yet, I accidentally deleted 
      the fullres versions and need to re copy them from my phone. That's what I get for working on the production 
      version.</p>

      <h2>Initial update</h2>
      
      <p><i>Jan 25th, 2022</i></p>
      
      <p>Hello! I've decided to make a news section as there's a lot of weirdness with hosting right now.</p>
      
      <p>I've done some hosting on neocities.org and now github, but neither allow me to host media. Neocities has 
        filetype restrictions and github has filesize restrictions.</p>
      
      <p>It's quite annoying. I do have a self-hosted copy of the site, but I don't have a domain for it, and my public 
        ip isn't stable, so I can't give it out. 
      
      <p>Some recent changes include the github mirror (<a href="https://ambersplace.github.io/" target="_blank" 
        aria-label="opens external site in a new window">ambersplace.github.io</a>) and some font optimizations. The 
        site should load faster and cleaner now.
      
      <p>That's all from me today. Thanks for browsing.</p>
