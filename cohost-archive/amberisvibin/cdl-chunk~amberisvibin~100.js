The Qu4rtering went after the EG writer for EG's shift on editorial stance (if you look up the original article you can see they added context to it after the fact.) So the writer got hate mobbed by GGaters for his troubles. And the fired employee then went off to work for the Qu4rtering. Basically they got played. Never platform GGaters, folks. Even if you do it by accident, if you then try to correct your mistake you still end up feeding the kind of outrage videos that the likes of the fucking Qu*tering will use to stoke up his hate mobs for more clicks and views.\n\nAnd IIRC Cyberpunk 2077 went on to use even more transphobic dogwhistling in its marketing. And I remember all the folks who boycotted the game for that. I remember the smaller streamers who were holding out against the huge popularity of the game just before release, willing to take a hit to views by not buying or streaming it. I also remember the longtime TTRPG fans who had been very excited about a video game based on Pondsmith's system for years and years, who sadly stepped back from it because they were so alienated by the marketing. \n\nThe studio has never taken any responsibility for all the hatred their fucking video game ginned up and aimed at anyone saying: \"Hey, this is transphobic. Please stop. I want to feel excited about this game, but this is putting me off. Please address this before release, so I can enjoy the game.\" They only ever doubled down.\n\nSo I wouldn't hold my breath on that one. \n\nBG3 is written by people who understand how to write what sex can feel like from the inside, so it can convincingly be any number of things at once, including being joyfully ridiculous on occasion. Eg: You can ask one of the Drow sex worker twins to roleplay having routine sex as if you've been married for over a decade, and he is written as being more shocked and turned on by the novelty of that, than by any of the other spicy scenarios you can ask him for. 😂 In that dialogue tree, you can then tell him that you want to roleplay being too tired to have sex, and so you both roll over and go to sleep. And he will do it. He will roll over and pretend to start snoring, but BEAR IN MIND THAT DROW DON'T SLEEP. HE IS FAKING THE SNORING JUST FOR YOUR GRATIFICATION! 🤣 It's warm and hilarious across several axes at once. \n\nYou will never see that kind of writing in a game that is pitched for GGaters.
