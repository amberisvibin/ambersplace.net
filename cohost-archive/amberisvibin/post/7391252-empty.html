(if you've got corrections for me, post a comment and if i agree i'll put it up here.)


PUTTING POWER IN CONTEXT

today i drove round trip between Seattle and Bellevue at mostly freeway speeds, averaging around 50-60 mph. my car, a kia EV6, told me i made this trip averaging 4.4 miles per kWh. if you flip that fraction around, you get 227 Wh/mi (or 141 Wh/km, which is evidently quite remarkable, particularly for highway driving [https://ev-database.org/cheatsheet/energy-consumption-electric-car]; in practice on 70 mph highways it fares much closer to the EV6 numbers listed on that site).

if you ask wolfram alpha about 227 Wh [https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=227+Wh] it'll give you some nice real-world comparisons, like &quot;one-fifth of the energy released by explosion of one kilogram of TNT&quot;, or &quot;5.3 times the energy capacity of the iPad 3 battery&quot;. again this is to go one mile. trying to wrap my mind around the fact that i can cook three potatoes in my microwave (900 W @ 15 min) for the same amount of energy as it takes to drive a mile throws me for a loop every time.

every mile you drive, you have to recharge that, right? unless you like turning stupidly expensive cars into bricks? it takes a little less than 10 minutes to recharge 227 Wh on a standard household circuit, or two days to recharge my car from 20% to 80%, and that's if you have the ability to charge at home. which i don't, because i live in an apartment.

so i have gotten to know public chargers a bit over the last three years and oh man let me tell you


WHY DO I NEED AN APP TO CHARGE MY CAR AGAIN?

again, the internet doesn't work anymore, and i don't have time to do real research like digging through newspaper archives and the federal register, so this is conjecture working backwards from what i know.

It Seems To Me that a lot of public EV charging infrastructure in the US was incentivized by tax credits. people in the US love to avoid paying taxes however they can, so tax credits end up being a great incentive to get rich people and business owners to do things. they gave out tax credits for buying EVs and for installing EV chargers, and so businesses installed EV chargers.

but businesses aren't just gonna dole out electricity for free. public &quot;level 2&quot; chargers are the equivalent of running your dryer on max heat for as long as a car is parked there and charging. and because it's The Future, business owners don't want to write down meter readings and charge customers directly, and car drivers don't want to be social ever.

this sounds like a great opportunity for a middleman. But Wait, if an average charging session is going to be an hour or so, and cars can only charge at a few kW because they can't do road trips yet, you're really only billing like $2-$3 per session. if you charge a credit card each time, like 10% of that is going to your card processor. it'd be cheaper for us, and thus for customers [citation needed], if we could bill them $10 or $20 at a time and maintain an account for them. and thus the Charging Network was born

this started a system of every single public EV charger requiring a fucking app, so that you can authenticate your prepaid payment account with an internet-connected EVSE. it is tiring. on my phone i currently have five separate apps solely for starting and stopping a charger i've plugged my car into. there was one charging network i had to use sometimes where they evidently lost the ability to update their old app, so you had to intuit that maybe there was a different app with the same name that might work. and these apps are just universally frustrating garbage interfaces

imagine if you had to install an app for every different company you bought your gas from. you have to type in your fucking credit card number, no autofill, no mobile wallet support, and if you don't do it fast enough your session times out. and if you don't have their app and you're out of cellular range or your phone is dead you just can't get gas, there is no other option. this is an era that public EV charging is still in, although we're thankfully slowly on the way out of.

the economics here are changing a bit, because drive batteries in cars are getting much, Much larger, and DC fast chargers are getting much faster, so a 30-minute charge session can easily push past $10 or $20, and it becomes far more economical to just put a damn credit card reader on the charger. (tesla, unsurprisingly, still refuses to do so; i also don't think i've ever seen a chargepoint charger with a credit card terminal either, but it doesn't seem like they own any of their chargers.)

A BRIEF ASIDE ON ELECTRIFY AMERICA

personally i give credit to the invention of &quot;put a credit card terminal on the charger&quot; to Electrify America, one of the first companies that decided to try and build out a DC fast charging network along major freeways to compete with tesla superchargers. (not directly compete, because at the time only tesla's cars could use their chargers, and wouldn't usually have any reason to use EA's, but you get what i mean.) there is not much credit to give them, honestly, because they are the only network that started primarily with DC fast charging in mind, so they never had to consider the implications of credit card processing fees eating 15-20% of their bottom line.

EA does not exist because the free market decided we needed a DC fast charging network open to any vehicle spread out across the vast US highway system. it exists because one of the conditions of volkswagen's settlement with US regulators from their emissions cheating scandal [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal] was to spend $2 billion on building &quot;clean-emissions infrastructure&quot;, including a public electric vehicle charging network.

i fundamentally do not believe that we would have any EV adoption in the US beyond tesla if it weren't for volkswagen teaching their cars to cheat on emissions tests.


WHY ARE ALL THE CHARGERS BROKEN?

consider the humble gas pump. it has had the benefit of a century of engineering to put up with Some Shit. people drive off with the hose still in the car so often that it is designed to get yoinked off as safely as possible and be replaced as cheaply as possible. every single one is inspected by your state's board of weights and measures. i would guess that most of their core components are interchangeable and readily available.

gas pumps are also placed at gas stations, which are businesses with the primary goal of selling you gas, and a secondary goal of getting you to buy overpriced sodas and dubious hot dogs and letting you pee. they usually have someone physically present working there who you can tell if something is broken, so they can report it to the business owner so it gets fixed, and they really would like it to get fixed as soon as possible because if a line forms, they're going to lose business to the guy across the street.

an EV charger is an afterthought. it leases space on someone else's property. there is no proprietor you can talk to without spending 15 minutes on hold. the nice ones are placed at wal-marts or big grocery stores where you probably need a code to get into the bathroom, but sometimes you're just chilling in a hotel parking lot in the middle of nowhere for 45 minutes with nothing to do. usually, nobody working at the wal-mart or the hotel or the mall can do a damn thing if the charger is broken, and they don't care either, because that's not their business.

an EV charger is a bespoke proprietary machine, known only to its manufacturer, and probably obsolete within three years. parts, if available, take weeks to arrive and weeks to be installed by a qualified electrician. the plugs themselves are way more fragile than a gas pump nozzle. for some godforsaken reason half of them run a shitty java app on windows embedded. also they have really thick copper wiring in them, so people have recently taken to chopping off the cables for scrap, which is really easy to do because nobody is around to notice.

a lot of the big DC fast charger networks own their equipment and lease space to operate them, but networks like chargepoint seem to not own any chargers. instead businesses (or increasingly, state departments of transportation and local electric utilities) buy chargers from chargepoint, presumably because they have to be the owner to get the tax credit, and then become responsible for maintenance. there's a tax credit for installing new EV chargers, but none for maintaining them. what the fuck do you think is going to happen?


WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG?

Batteries Are Fucking Terrible For Cars!!!!!

like i don't know. it is an incredible feat of engineering that my car can charge at 250 kW on a good day. it still takes like 20 minutes to get from 20% to 80%, and then it's slow as hell the rest of the way to 100%. there is only so much engineering you can do to batteries. and then they fucking wear out. i am fairly certain battery cars are not going to save us

i am still pretty bullish on hydrogen fuel cell cars — apparently i have been since i did a research paper on the topic in high school freshman english in 2007 — because it seems to me the only way you can avoid sitting at a charger for 30 minutes while still having an emissions-free vehicle. you can maybe do electrolysis on-site using the local grid or solar or whatever and the local water supply? (i guess this assumes a world where we won't have Water Wars in a decade or so)

but if we tried Everything, and i mean Everything, to decarbonize every vehicle in america and we still had to do it with battery cars, there's going to need to be a radical shift in how charging works. i think obviously we're going to have to figure out how to harmonize the fact that people who live in apartments sometimes need cars and they'll need to be able to charge them at home; four chargers for a 100-space garage isn't going to cut it. but we also need public charging infrastructure that understands that it takes thirty minutes to fill up a single car, and that there needs to be people working there to help customers and report (and maybe even fix!) problems.

one might imagine a small convenience store building with 15-20 fast chargers surrounding it to meet roughly the same capacity as a 4-pump gas station, but good god that is uh. probably 350 kW × 20 = 7 megawatts of potential grid load. realistically probably 5 MW tops. some napkin math using numbers from various press releases leads me to believe that a single walmart store might have a maximum load of half a megawatt during a heat wave, and in a lot of places in the US that's probably the largest continuous grid load in the area unless you've got major factories nearby.

there is the idea of putting batteries inside the EV chargers themselves, so that you can smooth out the grid load while still providing fast charging for cars. but now you're adding more precious metals to the system???

anyone who thinks this is the future, this is how we fix climate change, doesn't know what this shit is like and how bleak the future of battery EVs is. thanks for reading my TED talk"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:type" content="article"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:published_time" content="2024-08-22T07:44:47.450Z"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:author" content="https://cohost.org/iliana"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:url" content="https://cohost.org/amberisvibin/post/7391252-empty"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:tag" content="electric vehicles"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image" content="https://staging.cohostcdn.org/avatar/465-fcf6f50f-b9c9-4c4d-9365-a2e7bd7e39c4-profile.jpg"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image:alt" content="iliana"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image:width" content="128"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image:height" content="128"><meta data-rh="true" property="twitter:card" content="summary">

This is the one I kinda can wrap my head around cause the logic makes sense to a layman who has seen the periodic table. Basically, Hydrogen is the smallest element, it can get out the tiniest gap it can find. It's super hard to find a kind of tank to store it that the hydrogen atoms can't just physically pass through. You have to do a bunch of stuff with pressure and temperature to keep it from escaping, but said techniques don't really jive well with regular wear and tear of transportation. Imagine having to do a full teardown of a gas pump every time there is a suspected leak because all it takes is a microfracture that is invisible to the naked eye to cause all the fuel in the tank to evaporate away.

But let's talk about metals, lithium specifically.\n\nLithium deposits are found worldwide, but only a handful are rich enough to make it worth mining, and most of those are in the global south, with the richest in south america. Lithium batteries are a genuine miracle of chemical engineering and design, something you can recharge hundreds of times that has relatively high stability (dont puncture it!) and energy density.\n\nThere's a lot of countries jockeying to either take over or strike deals with countries with large lithium deposits because the american corpos (largely but not solely tesla) decided that this is the way forwards, so we're dragged along with it. If half a second of thought had been given to it, there'd have been a \"eureka!\" moment where people realized that the batteries themselves are completely disposable.\n\nYou use them for 4-5 years and they practically wont hold a charge, especially if youve been bashing them with fast charging during that whole time, which seems to be the only way to make the time economy of electric vehicles even remotely a thing. Then you have to rip out the battery pack and pay for a full replacement, which can range from 7000$ to 30000$. At that point you might as well just buy a new car, that's full engine and transmission rebuild money on any ICE vehicle.\n\nOn top of all of this, i haven't heard fucking boo about lithium reclamation and recycling from these batteries, probably because we haven't hit the point where it becomes \"economical\" aka the criticality point where raw lithium is already nearly gone entirely. There's so much lithium wasted in little e-devices already that probably outweighs EV waste.\n\nAnd don't get me started on cobalt and copper-nickel mining and solar panels.\n\nEVs are not, never were, and never will be the way forwards. Hydrogen is more complex, yes, but vastly more regenerable.\n\nMy really weird hope for the future though? Hydrocarbon production through the capture of CO2 and water. Strip the greenhouse gasses out of the air and use them to fuel the engines we already have decades of engineering in.\n","children":[],"postId":7389209,"inReplyTo":null,"hasCohostPlus":false,"hidden":false},"canInteract":"not-allowed","canEdit":"not-allowed","canHide":"not-allowed","poster":{"projectId":9948,"handle":"ashendral","displayName":"ashendral","dek":"Faggot extreme, Queer to the max.","description":"We are the Dream System.

because i want it to be a Good Blog Post, i want to cite my sources, i want to do my research. and it's fucking impossible to do so anymore. if i want to look up old tax credits for EV charger installation all i get is articles about how to apply for the credit reintroduced in 2023. it sucks. so i'm just going to write my unsourced rant with things that i've convinced myself of over the last few years of driving an EV without being able to charge at home. (if you've got corrections for me, post a comment and if i agree i'll put it up here.)<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><h3>putting power in context<!-- --></h3>
<!-- --><p>today i drove round trip between Seattle and Bellevue at mostly freeway speeds, averaging around 50-60 mph. my car, a kia EV6, told me i made this trip averaging 4.4 miles per kWh. if you flip that fraction around, you get 227 Wh/mi (or 141 Wh/km, which is <!-- --><a href="https://ev-database.org/cheatsheet/energy-consumption-electric-car" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">evidently quite remarkable, particularly for highway driving<!-- --></a>; in practice on 70 mph highways it fares much closer to the EV6 numbers listed on that site).<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>if you ask wolfram alpha about <!-- --><a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=227+Wh" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">227 Wh<!-- --></a> it'll give you some nice real-world comparisons, like "one-fifth of the energy released by explosion of one kilogram of TNT", or "5.3 times the energy capacity of the iPad 3 battery". again this is to go <!-- --><em>one mile<!-- --></em>. trying to wrap my mind around the fact that i can cook three potatoes in my microwave (900 W @ 15 min) for the same amount of energy as it takes to drive a mile throws me for a loop every time.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>every mile you drive, you have to recharge that, right? unless you like turning stupidly expensive cars into bricks? it takes a little less than 10 minutes to recharge 227 Wh on a standard household circuit, or <!-- --><em>two days<!-- --></em> to recharge my car from 20% to 80%, and that's if you have the ability to charge at home. which i don't, because i live in an apartment.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>so i have gotten to know public chargers a bit over the last three years and oh man let me tell you<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><h3>why do i need an app to charge my car again?<!-- --></h3>
<!-- --><p>again, the internet doesn't work anymore, and i don't have time to do real research like digging through newspaper archives and the federal register, so this is conjecture working backwards from what i know.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>It Seems To Me that a lot of public EV charging infrastructure in the US was incentivized by tax credits. people in the US love to avoid paying taxes however they can, so tax credits end up being a great incentive to get rich people and business owners to do things. they gave out tax credits for buying EVs and for installing EV chargers, and so businesses installed EV chargers.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>but businesses aren't just gonna dole out electricity for free. public "level 2" chargers are the equivalent of running your dryer on max heat for as long as a car is parked there and charging. and because it's The Future, business owners don't want to write down meter readings and charge customers directly, and car drivers don't want to be social ever.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>this sounds like a great opportunity for a middleman. But Wait, if an average charging session is going to be an hour or so, and cars can only charge at a few kW because they can't do road trips yet, you're really only billing like $2-$3 per session. if you charge a credit card each time, like 10% of that is going to your card processor. it'd be cheaper for us, and thus for customers [<!-- --><em>citation needed<!-- --></em>], if we could bill them $10 or $20 at a time and maintain an account for them. and thus the Charging Network was born<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>this started a system of every single public EV charger requiring a fucking app, so that you can authenticate your prepaid payment account with an internet-connected EVSE. it is tiring. on my phone i currently have <!-- --><em><strong>five<!-- --></strong></em> separate apps solely for starting and stopping a charger i've plugged my car into. there was one charging network i had to use sometimes where they evidently lost the ability to update their old app, so you had to intuit that maybe there was a <!-- --><em>different app with the same name<!-- --></em> that might work. and these apps are just universally frustrating garbage interfaces<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>imagine if you had to install an app for every different company you bought your gas from. you have to type in your fucking credit card number, no autofill, no mobile wallet support, and if you don't do it fast enough your session times out. and if you don't have their app and you're out of cellular range or <!-- --><em>your phone is dead<!-- --></em> you just can't get gas, there is no other option. this is an era that public EV charging is still in, although we're thankfully slowly on the way out of.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>the economics here are changing a bit, because drive batteries in cars are getting much, Much larger, and DC fast chargers are getting much faster, so a 30-minute charge session can easily push past $10 or $20, and it becomes far more economical to just put a damn credit card reader on the charger. (tesla, unsurprisingly, still refuses to do so; i also don't think i've ever seen a chargepoint charger with a credit card terminal either, but it doesn't seem like they own any of their chargers.)<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><h4>a brief aside on electrify america<!-- --></h4>
<!-- --><p>personally i give credit to the invention of "put a credit card terminal on the charger" to Electrify America, one of the first companies that decided to try and build out a DC fast charging network along major freeways to compete with tesla superchargers. (not <!-- --><em>directly<!-- --></em> compete, because at the time only tesla's cars could use their chargers, and wouldn't usually have any reason to use EA's, but you get what i mean.) there is not much credit to give them, honestly, because they are the only network that started primarily with DC fast charging in mind, so they never had to consider the implications of credit card processing fees eating 15-20% of their bottom line.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>EA does not exist because the free market decided we needed a DC fast charging network open to any vehicle spread out across the vast US highway system. it exists because one of the conditions of volkswagen's settlement with US regulators from their <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">emissions cheating scandal<!-- --></a> was to spend $2 billion on building "clean-emissions infrastructure", including a public electric vehicle charging network.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>i fundamentally do not believe that we would have any EV adoption in the US beyond tesla if it weren't for volkswagen teaching their cars to cheat on emissions tests.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><h3>why are all the chargers broken?<!-- --></h3>
<!-- --><p>consider the humble gas pump. it has had the benefit of a century of engineering to put up with Some Shit. people drive off with the hose still in the car so often that it is designed to get yoinked off as safely as possible and be replaced as cheaply as possible. every single one is inspected by your state's board of weights and measures. i would guess that most of their core components are interchangeable and readily available.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>gas pumps are also placed at gas stations, which are businesses with the primary goal of selling you gas, and a secondary goal of getting you to buy overpriced sodas and dubious hot dogs and letting you pee. they usually have someone physically present working there who you can tell if something is broken, so they can report it to the business owner so it gets fixed, and they really would like it to get fixed as soon as possible because if a line forms, they're going to lose business to the guy across the street.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>an EV charger is an afterthought. it leases space on someone else's property. there is no proprietor you can talk to without spending 15 minutes on hold. the nice ones are placed at wal-marts or big grocery stores where you probably need a code to get into the bathroom, but sometimes you're just chilling in a hotel parking lot in the middle of nowhere for 45 minutes with nothing to do. usually, nobody working at the wal-mart or the hotel or the mall can do a damn thing if the charger is broken, and they don't care either, because that's not their business.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>an EV charger is a bespoke proprietary machine, known only to its manufacturer, and probably obsolete within three years. parts, if available, take weeks to arrive and weeks to be installed by a qualified electrician. the plugs themselves are way more fragile than a gas pump nozzle. for some godforsaken reason half of them run a shitty java app on windows embedded. also they have really thick copper wiring in them, so people have recently taken to chopping off the cables for scrap, which is really easy to do because <!-- --><em>nobody is around to notice<!-- --></em>.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>a lot of the big DC fast charger networks own their equipment and lease space to operate them, but networks like chargepoint seem to not own <!-- --><em>any<!-- --></em> chargers. instead businesses (or increasingly, state departments of transportation and local electric utilities) buy chargers from chargepoint, presumably because they have to be the owner to get the tax credit, and then become responsible for maintenance. there's a tax credit for installing new EV chargers, but none for maintaining them. what the fuck do you think is going to happen?<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><h3>why does it take so long?<!-- --></h3>
<!-- --><p>Batteries Are Fucking Terrible For Cars!!!!!<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>like i don't know. it is an incredible feat of engineering that my car can charge at 250 kW on a good day. it still takes like 20 minutes to get from 20% to 80%, and then it's slow as hell the rest of the way to 100%. there is only so much engineering you can do to batteries. and then they fucking wear out. i am fairly certain battery cars are not going to save us<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>i am still pretty bullish on hydrogen fuel cell cars — apparently i have been since i did a research paper on the topic in high school freshman english in 2007 — because it seems to me the only way you can avoid sitting at a charger for 30 minutes while still having an emissions-free vehicle. you can maybe do electrolysis on-site using the local grid or solar or whatever and the local water supply? (i guess this assumes a world where we won't have Water Wars in a decade or so)<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>but if we tried Everything, and i mean <!-- --><em>Everything<!-- --></em>, to decarbonize every vehicle in america and we still had to do it with battery cars, there's going to need to be a radical shift in how charging works. i think obviously we're going to have to figure out how to harmonize the fact that people who live in apartments sometimes need cars and they'll need to be able to charge them at home; four chargers for a 100-space garage isn't going to cut it. but we also need public charging infrastructure that understands that it takes <!-- --><em>thirty minutes<!-- --></em> to fill up a single car, and that there needs to be people working there to help customers and report (and maybe even fix!) problems.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>one might imagine a small convenience store building with 15-20 fast chargers surrounding it to meet roughly the same capacity as a 4-pump gas station, but good god that is uh. probably 350 kW × 20 = <!-- --><strong>7 megawatts<!-- --></strong> of potential grid load. realistically probably 5 MW tops. some napkin math using numbers from various press releases leads me to believe that a single walmart store might have a maximum load of half a megawatt during a heat wave, and in a lot of places in the US that's probably the largest continuous grid load in the area unless you've got major factories nearby.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>there is the idea of putting batteries inside the EV chargers themselves, so that you can smooth out the grid load while still providing fast charging for cars. but now you're adding more precious metals to the system???<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>anyone who thinks this is the future, this is how we fix climate change, doesn't know what this shit is like and how bleak the future of battery EVs is. thanks for reading my TED talk<!-- --></p></div></div><div class="w-full max-w-full p-3"><div class="co-tags relative w-full overflow-y-hidden break-words leading-none max-h-[60px]"><div><a class="mr-2 inline-block text-sm hover:underline  " href="https://cohost.org/amberisvibin/tagged/electric%20vehicles">#<!-- -->electric vehicles<!-- --></a></div><div class="absolute bottom-0 right-2 flex h-5"><span class="co-from-body inline-block h-full bg-gradient-to-l pl-4"></span><button class="co-tags co-opaque inline-block cursor-pointer text-sm font-bold hover:underline">see all</button></div></div></div></div></div></div><hr class="co-hairline"><footer class="co-thread-footer w-full max-w-full rounded-b-lg p-3"><div class="flex justify-between align-middle"><div class="w-max flex-none"><a href="https://cohost.org/amberisvibin/post/7391252-empty#comments" class="text-sm hover:underline">22 comments<!-- --></a></div><div class="flex items-center justify-end gap-3"><div style="position:fixed;top:1px;left:1px;width:1px;height:0;padding:0;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border-width:0;display:none"></div><div style="position:fixed;top:1px;left:1px;width:1px;height:0;padding:0;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border-width:0;display:none"></div><div style="position:fixed;top:1px;left:1px;width:1px;height:0;padding:0;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border-width:0;display:none"></div><button title="delete this post"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" class="co-action-button h-6 w-6"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M14.74 9l-.346 9m-4.788 0L9.26 9m9.968-3.21c.342.052.682.107 1.022.166m-1.022-.165L18.16 19.673a2.25 2.25 0 01-2.244 2.077H8.084a2.25 2.25 0 01-2.244-2.077L4.772 5.79m14.456 0a48.108 48.108 0 00-3.478-.397m-12 .562c.34-.059.68-.114 1.022-.165m0 0a48.11 48.11 0 013.478-.397m7.5 0v-.916c0-1.18-.91-2.164-2.09-2.201a51.964 51.964 0 00-3.32 0c-1.18.037-2.09 1.022-2.09 2.201v.916m7.5 0a48.667 48.667 0 00-7.5 0"></path></svg></button><a href="https://cohost.org/amberisvibin/post/7391252-empty/edit" class="co-action-button h-6 w-6" title="edit this post"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M16.862 4.487l1.687-1.688a1.875 1.875 0 112.652 2.652L10.582 16.07a4.5 4.5 0 01-1.897 1.13L6 18l.8-2.685a4.5 4.5 0 011.13-1.897l8.932-8.931zm0 0L19.5 7.125M18 14v4.75A2.25 2.25 0 0115.75 21H5.25A2.25 2.25 0 013 18.75V8.25A2.25 2.25 0 015.25 6H10"></path></svg></a><button class="w-6 h-6 pointer relative" title="unlike this post as amberisvibin"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 24 24" fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" class="w-6 h-6 pointer absolute top-0 left-0 text-cherry visible"><path d="M11.645 20.91l-.007-.003-.022-.012a15.247 15.247 0 01-.383-.218 25.18 25.18 0 01-4.244-3.17C4.688 15.36 2.25 12.174 2.25 8.25 2.25 5.322 4.714 3 7.688 3A5.5 5.5 0 0112 5.052 5.5 5.5 0 0116.313 3c2.973 0 5.437 2.322 5.437 5.25 0 3.925-2.438 7.111-4.739 9.256a25.175 25.175 0 01-4.244 3.17 15.247 15.247 0 01-.383.219l-.022.012-.007.004-.003.001a.752.752 0 01-.704 0l-.003-.001z"></path></svg><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" class="w-6 h-6 pointer absolute top-0 left-0 co-action-button invisible"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M21 8.25c0-2.485-2.099-4.5-4.688-4.5-1.935 0-3.597 1.126-4.312 2.733-.715-1.607-2.377-2.733-4.313-2.733C5.1 3.75 3 5.765 3 8.25c0 7.22 9 12 9 12s9-4.78 9-12z"></path></svg></button></div></div></footer></article><div id="comments" class="relative -top-16"></div><div data-theme="both" class="co-themed-box co-comment-box cohost-shadow-light dark:cohost-shadow-dark w-full max-w-full rounded-lg p-3 lg:max-w-prose"><div class="flex flex-col gap-4"><div class="relative grid w-full overflow-auto"><div class="invisible col-start-1 col-end-2 row-start-1 row-end-2

This is the one I kinda can wrap my head around cause the logic makes sense to a layman who has seen the periodic table. Basically, Hydrogen is the smallest element, it can get out the tiniest gap it can find. It's super hard to find a kind of tank to store it that the hydrogen atoms can't just physically pass through. You have to do a bunch of stuff with pressure and temperature to keep it from escaping, but said techniques don't really jive well with regular wear and tear of transportation. Imagine having to do a full teardown of a gas pump every time there is a suspected leak because all it takes is a microfracture that is invisible to the naked eye to cause all the fuel in the tank to evaporate away. I'm not saying its impossible, I'm very sure that we can fix these bugs given enough real world testing; what I am saying that it will take a concerted effort that I don't think the Government nor the Citizenship really want to embark on.<!-- --></p></div><div class="flex flex-row items-center gap-2"><span class="co-link-button-disabled flex cursor-not-allowed

Solar is, in 2024, a safe, well-understood investment that megabanks can easily underwrite, and they buy solar tax credit investments by the hundreds of millions of dollars.  It is genuinely amazing the degree of solar development by the credits.  All that said, regrettably, it remains to be seen whether the bonanza of new clean energy sources will actually have the effect of reducing reliance on fossil fuels, because AI datacenters are guzzling new energy faster even than it can be produced.<!-- --></p></div><div class="flex flex-row items-center gap-2"><span class="co-link-button-disabled flex cursor-not-allowed

<!-- --><p>But the more information i learned about them, the more i come to despise them.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>On the face of it, "not burning fossil fuels" is a really good thing to be doing. But let's talk about metals, lithium specifically.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Lithium deposits are found worldwide, but only a handful are rich enough to make it worth mining, and most of those are in the global south, with the richest in south america. Lithium batteries are a genuine miracle of chemical engineering and design, something you can recharge hundreds of times that has relatively high stability (dont puncture it!) and energy density.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>There's a lot of countries jockeying to either take over or strike deals with countries with large lithium deposits because the american corpos (largely but not solely tesla) decided that this is the way forwards, so we're dragged along with it. If half a second of thought had been given to it, there'd have been a "eureka!" moment where people realized that the batteries themselves are completely disposable.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>You use them for 4-5 years and they practically wont hold a charge, especially if youve been bashing them with fast charging during that whole time, which seems to be the only way to make the time economy of electric vehicles even remotely a thing. Then you have to rip out the battery pack and pay for a full replacement, which can range from 7000$ to 30000$. At that point you might as well just buy a new car, that's full engine and transmission rebuild money on any ICE vehicle.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>On top of all of this, i haven't heard fucking boo about lithium reclamation and recycling from these batteries, probably because we haven't hit the point where it becomes "economical" aka the criticality point where raw lithium is already nearly gone entirely. There's so much lithium wasted in little e-devices already that probably outweighs EV waste.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>And don't get me started on cobalt and copper-nickel mining and solar panels.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>EVs are not, never were, and never will be the way forwards. Hydrogen is more complex, yes, but vastly more regenerable.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>My really weird hope for the future though? Hydrocarbon production through the capture of CO2 and water. Strip the greenhouse gasses out of the air and use them to fuel the engines we already have decades of engineering in.<!-- --></p></div><div class="flex flex-row items-center gap-2"><span class="co-link-button-disabled flex cursor-not-allowed
