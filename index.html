    <p>i'm a tired transbian and i want to put shit on the internet.</p>

    <p>i believe in free as in freedom, but not in a gnu or <abbr title="free software foundation">fsf</abbr> sort of 
      way. i believe in an internet far away from the overly corporate social media giants we see today. i believe in open source, public domain, and creative commons. that's why this site exists, a sanctuary away from an increasingly exploitative web.</p>
    
    <p>this site is coded by me, by hand. my goals for this site are for it to be free, accessible, and compatible. 
      it's free as in it's public domain where it can be, and as open a license as possible where it can't. its 
      accessible as in all images have alt text and any other media is described where possible. it's compatible as in 
      this site can be viewed on just about anything with as few issues as possible. the only exception to this is 
      HTML5 audio, as it is currently the best way to serve audio over the web. wherever HTML5 audio is used, i will 
      provide an alternative download and raw file link.
