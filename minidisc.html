    <h2>new collection</h2>

    <p>since the hurricane, some very nice folks on the <a href="https://www.minidisc.wiki/">Minidisc.wiki</a> sold
      me a couple of good machines for reasonable prices (or free!)</p>

    <p>the first machine i got is a panasonic sj-mr250. it's my first netmd recorder, and a beautiful machine.
      it docks into a little stand that has some speakers, and the speakers sound suprisingly good! i'm a big fan.</p>

    <p>the second machine i got is a sony mz-e620. it's a very small mdlp player, and i like it a lot. it's very
      portable, and it's inline remote is nice. i've been using it for on-the-go md.

    <h2>old collection (gone)</h2>

    <p>all of my minidisc machines were destroyed in hurricane helene. i had more than just these two, but never got
      around to showing them off</p>

    <p>i had two Sony MZ-R50 minidisc recorders. these recorders are from 1997, and don't have features like
      MDLP or NetMD. they were both still extremely solid, however.</p>
    
    <p>one unit currently works flawlessly, and the other is broken. it fails to read the disc. the one that works is 
      in amazing condition, with only a few scratches.</p>
    
    <p>i tried to modify the sony lip-8 battery it came with to install a new cell, but failed. i found a 
      Sanyo UR14500 cell, which was compatible with the original 14650 cell, but a bit shorter. unfortunately, i did 
      not order it with tabs welded to it, so i tried to use springs from a battery compartment, but accidentally 
      melted the casing with my soldering iron. i will try again with another battery whenever i get one.</p>

    <p>i also had a Sony MZ-E75 player portable from 1999. it's pretty yellowed but works flawlessly.</p>

    <p>i had purchased a "prerecorded" md from needlejuice records. it's a copy of Spirit Phone by Lemon Demon.
      i quite like the printing on the disc itself, it looks really cool.</p>
