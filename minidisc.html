    <p>i currently have two Sony MZ-R50 minidisc recorders. these recorders are from 1997, and don't have features like 
      MDLP or NetMD. they are still both extremely solid, however.</p>
    
    <p>one unit currently works flawlessly, and the other is broken. it fails to read the disc. the one that works is 
      in amazing condition, with only a few scratches.</p>
    
    <p>i tried to modify the sony lip-8 battery it came with to install a new cell, but failed. i found a 
      Sanyo UR14500 cell, which was compatible with the original 14650 cell, but a bit shorter. unfortunately, i did 
      not order it with tabs welded to it, so i tried to use springs from a battery compartment, but accidentally 
      melted the casing with my soldering iron. i will try again with another battery whenever i get one.</p>

    <p>i also have a Sony MZ-E75 player portable from 1999. it's pretty yellowed but works flawlessly.</p>

    <p>i have purchased a "prerecorded" md from needlejuice records. it's a copy of Spirit Phone by Lemon Demon. 
      i quite like the printing on the disc itself, it looks really cool.</p>
