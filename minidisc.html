    <p>i currently have two Sony MZ-R50 minidisc recorders. these recorders are from 1997, and don't have features like MDLP or NetMD. they are still both extremely solid, however.</p>
    
    <p>one unit currently works flawlessly, and the other is broken. it fails to read the disc. the one that works is in amazing condition, with only a few scratches.</p>
    
    <p>i tried to modify the sony lip-8 battery it came with to install a new sanyo ur14500 cell, but failed. i found a Sanyo UR14500 cell, which was compatible with the original 14650 cell, but a bit shorter. unfortunately, i did not order it with tabs welded to it, so i tried to use springs from a battery compartment, but accidentally melted the casing with my soldering iron. i will try again with another battery whenever i get one.</p>
